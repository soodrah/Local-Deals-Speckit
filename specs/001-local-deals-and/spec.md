## Clarifications
- Q: For manual location entry (if location services are disabled), what format should users use? ‚Üí A: Both city and zip allowed
- Q: How should the app handle AdMob failures (ads not loading or displaying)? ‚Üí A: Silently hide ad space and log error to notify admin for review
- Q: How should the app detect and handle fraudulent ratings or deal validations? ‚Üí A: Use automated AI-based fraud detection
- Q: How should the app prevent multiple redemptions of the same deal by a user? ‚Üí A: Allow multiple redemptions with time limit (e.g., once per day)
### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: How should the app handle cases where location services are disabled for a user? ‚Üí A: Prompt user to enable location for best experience

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user opens the app, sees a curated list of local deals based on their location and preferences, browses available offers, and redeems a deal at a nearby store using a QR or barcode. The user can rate the deal, validate its authenticity, and invite friends to join and share deals.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has location services enabled, **When** they open the app, **Then** they see deals from nearby stores and services.
2. **Given** the user browses deals, **When** they select a deal, **Then** they can view details and redeem it using a QR/barcode.
3. **Given** the user redeems a deal, **When** they rate and validate it, **Then** the system records their feedback.
4. **Given** the user wants to share the app, **When** they invite friends, **Then** friends receive an invitation and can join.
5. **Given** the user is within a geo-fenced area, **When** a relevant deal is available, **Then** they receive a notification.

### Edge Cases
- If location services are disabled and manual entry is used, users may enter both city and zip code.
- If location services are disabled, the app prompts the user to enable location for best experience.
- How does the system handle expired or invalid deals?
- If a user tries to redeem the same deal multiple times, the app enforces a time limit (e.g., once per day) for redemptions.
- Fraudulent ratings or validations are detected and handled using automated AI-based fraud detection.
- If AdMob fails to load ads, the app will silently hide the ad space and log the error to notify admin for review.
